* Netmon - Cross Platform Internet / Network Monitoring Application 

*What is it?*

It is small and simple open-source and cross-platform graphical app
for monitoring internet connection. This program pools an known
internet address (www.google.com and the address of this host name
216.58.222.100) in a regular time interval to check the connection
status. While Windows has this functionality, this application
provides more feedback about the network status, for instance, it can
diagnose the case when the network is working, but the DNS is failing.
